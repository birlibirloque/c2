Add Conan C/C++ Package Manager.

Steps:

* Install conan (https://conanio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#)
* Clone this repo
* cd c2
* mkdir build
* cd build
* conan install .. --build=missing
* cmake .. -G "Generating Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
* cmake --build .

Fix the code!!

### Branch 1

I prefer write an assertion before an object because:

* I focus in what i need to resolved, not in how i need to resolved it
* I don't know if i will need a class
* Class is more complex structure than a function
* I agree to write code in a single file in first stages
